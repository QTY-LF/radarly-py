radarly-py's documentation
==========================

This folder contains the documentation of the official API of Radarly and the
documentation for the Python's client. The HTML version of the documentation is
hosted on https://api.linkfluence.com. By reading it, you will get all the
knowledges to interact with our APIs.

This documentation has been built with Sphinx (version 1.7.0). If you want, you
can get a local version of the documentation by building the HTML files with
Sphinx. Follow these steps to build the files:

- Install all the requirements with ``pip install -r requirements_doc.txt``
- Go in the directory where the documentation is stored (the same directory as
  this file).
- Run ``make html`` in order to build the files.
- The built files are now in the ``_build/html`` folder. The home file of the
  documentation is ``index.html``.


This documentation will be updated as the same time as the client. If you find
a glitch in the documentation, please contact us at python@linkfuence.com.

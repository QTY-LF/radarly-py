Quickstart
----------

.. _documentation: /python/radarly.html

This section of the documentation has been built to give you all the keys
needed to start using the Python client. Although you will learn a lot about
the package here, the most efficient way to master the client is to practice
(the actual rate limits allow you to get familiar with the client without
being blocked).

If you want to know deeply how to work with the package, don't hesitate to
check the API documentation_ of the package. It will teach you all the secrets
of the client and consequently, how to use it in the best way.
